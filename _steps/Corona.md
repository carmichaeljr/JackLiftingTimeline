Alternate title: THE GYMS ARE CLOSED
Alternate title two: FUCK

Ok, so the gyms are closed and I am sitting at home doing homework slowly losing my mind. I need to do something.

Solution: lift rocks. Turns out that I could get some strongman training in after all!

In all seriousness, I quite enjoyed doing this. If I ever do get a home gym I will probably have a stone set just because this was so fun. Lifting rocks built my upper back like crazy, and I am hopping that if the gyms ever do open again this will carry over well to deadlifts.
