Here it is! I am back to where I was before coronacation...mostly. I have matched my old PR, but I am five pounds heavier now than I was the first time I pulled 405 lbs. So I can no longer say that I pull three times my body weight. In order to say that I need to pull somewhere in the neighborhood of 425 lbs, which would be an all time PR. This rep was not as easy as I was hopping, it stalled out at my knees big time, but luckily I was able to pull through it. In order to pull more weight I need to clean up my form a little more so that I don't have such a big stall out at my knees.
