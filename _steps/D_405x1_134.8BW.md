There was a deadlift only meet at my college, and having never competed before, I thought it would be fun to partake in. I had the main goal of pulling 405 lbs, but also had a secondary goal of pulling three times my bodyweight. In order to pull three times bodyweight I needed to weight less than 135 lbs, and I currently weighed 138 lbs. There was a two hour weight in, so I cut water the night before and didn't drink anything the next morning. I ended up weighing in at 134.8 lbs, 0.2 lbs under what I had to be. With that completed, I just had to pull the weight. This was a true max effort, all out, leaving nothing in the tank lift. Had there not been such a supportive crowd cheering me on, I doubt I would have been able to to it. Once I pulled it however, I accomplished both of my goals. Now that three times body weight is completed, four times is already in my head. I know that it is far off, but the thought is still there...
