Ok, I know that it is not a PR, but it is a post corona PR. Coming back from corona was challenging at first, but it did give me the opportunity to rethink many of my previously held notions. I created a new lifting program that increased both the intensity and volume of my pre-corona training. It turns out that I was actually undertrained before. I also took the opportunity to clean up my form on all three lifts while the weights were still light. My deadlift form took quite a while to dial back in, but as you can see in the video it is getting closer every time I deadlift. 405 lbs here we come.
