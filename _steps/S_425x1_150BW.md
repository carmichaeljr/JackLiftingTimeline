This rotation has been absolutely amazing for my squat. I started a new workout program where I increased the squat volume and it has worked magic for my squats. My goal for this rotation was a 405 lb squat, but I ended up hitting 425 lbs and attempting 455 lbs! For my next workout program I will be increasing the squat volume again because my body responded so well to it this rotation.
