After a couple more weeks I was able to hit a 10 lb PR on bench. For some reason my bench has been feeling good the past couple weeks and I decided to take advantage of that and got for a PR (even though spreadsheet didn't say so). 240 lbs was a bit of a grind but I was able to get it! On an interesting side note I can say that my bench is 100 lbs more than my bodyweight, which is an interesting fact I suppose.
