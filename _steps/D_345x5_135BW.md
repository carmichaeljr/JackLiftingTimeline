The progress continues! Another 10 lb deadlift PR, and for reps none the less. Things are really moving now. You can see that I am wearing different shoes in the video, they are wrestling shoes that my roommate kindly donated to me after hearing that I could not lift in just my socks in the gym. I think that they have helped my deadlift starting position immensely. They have a raised toe, which forces me to lean back before I pull, which is helping me get my back tight before I pull. It is amazing how such a small difference can corelate to such large changes in the amount of weight lifted.
