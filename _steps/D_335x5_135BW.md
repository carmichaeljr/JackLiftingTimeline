At last some progress! My deadlift has not been going very well for quite some time now, and I do not know why. On my last deadlift PR I posted that I was having some trouble with my form and the struggle bus has continued until just recently. At least now things are starting to feel better and move like they should again. I am hopeful some new PR's will come soon.
