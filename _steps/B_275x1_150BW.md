Finally, a 275 lb bench! This has been a huge goal of mine for quite some time now, and I finally got it this rotation! My bench PR was 240 lbs at the start of this rotation, so I was not expecting this but the increased bench volume has really worked it's magic. I did slightly strain my left pec while attempting this, so I will be taking a couple weeks off of bench to let that recover.
