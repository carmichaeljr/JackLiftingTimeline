This was an interesting PR. The first time I attempted it the bar rolled up my back because I was leaning forward to much, which allowed for my arms to push the weight forward and make it start rolling up my back. This of course is a BAD thing so I stopped immediately and let the rack catch the weight. I felt like I had the energy to try again, so I did and this time I was super focused on form. I got the lift, making it a 15 lb PR, but this is something that I will need to be more vigilant about in the future.
