I was not expecting to hit a 260 lb bench today! My spreadsheet called for a 230 lb AMRAP, but I was feeling pretty good so I decided to go for it, and I am glad that I did! This is a 20 lb PR over my previous rotations PR. Just like my squats, I have added more volume to my bench this rotation, and my body has responded very well. One thing that I think is really helping drive my bench up is all the paused bench work that I'm doing. Next rotation I will be adding a lot more.
