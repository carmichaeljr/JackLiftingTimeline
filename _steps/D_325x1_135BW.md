After finally hitting 315 lbs on my deadlift I hit a major plateau. For the entire summer I could not progress past 315 lbs. Luckily I continued to push my squats so my strength is still there, I just needed to get my form back into check. In the past couple weeks however things have started to feel better and I felt confident enough to try a 325 lbs deadlift. Despite being a hard rep, I still was able to complete it. Hopefully the progress continues!
