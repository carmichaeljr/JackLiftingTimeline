Another 20 lb deadlift PR. I am not going to lie, I was rather disappointed in this lift. Based off of my 345 lb deadlift set, I was hoping to get three reps minimum, but I only managed to get one rep. Still, I cannot be too disappointed because I did hit it. Onward and upward! One thing I must say is that 405 lbs has been on my mind for quite some time now. Possibly it could happen soon? Time will tell I suppose.
