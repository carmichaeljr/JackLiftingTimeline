A couple more weeks and another 25 lb PR! This one was a grind for sure, but I got it, and I definitely hit depth. I can feel my squats starting to plateau so I am going to start a new rotation after this week that will hopefully reinstate the progress I was having before. To be honest, I am kind of looking forward to the lighter weights in the next few weeks, my body could use the rest.
